        <h2> About This Project </h2>
        <p> This website was created as a way to give myself experience as a web developer. I hope to learn HTML, CSS,
            Javascript, and much more. </p>
        <p> In the future, I want this website to display my most important experiences as a developer. I have a few
            ideas,
            like embedding a video game I created in Unity, but a vast majority of this website will be one big
            improvisation.<br><br>Wish me luck! </p>

        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p> My name is Christian Cox (I hope you know by now) and I'm currently a senior at Louisiana State University.
            I am
            graduating with a bachelor's degree in computer science with a concentration in software engineering in the
            spring
            of 2022. </p>
        <p> I was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. I enjoy playing basketball, cooking and eating amazing
            food,
            and playing lots of video games. </p>
        <!--<p> My dream is to create and design video games. I played my first MMORPG, Runescape, at the age of five, on a desktop PC in Tulane
        University's Riley Center in 2004, and have also been addicted to World of Warcraft from the age of eight. I believe I
        have a lot to offer in the MMORPG space of game design, but I need more experience to pursue this passion.</p> -->
